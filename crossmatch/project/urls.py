"""Root URLconf for the crossmatch project.

Greenfield HTTP surface: this project historically ran only Celery workers and
Kafka/PubSub consumers with no web entry point. The web workload
(``entrypoints/run_web.sh``) serves the read-model API mounted under ``api/``
(see ``api/urls.py``) plus a health path for liveness/readiness probes. Auth for
the API path is handled at the ingress, not here (R11). The Django admin is
deliberately not mounted: the DEV ingress routes only ``/api`` to this workload
and the endpoint is public, so exposing an admin login here would be surface
with no gate.
