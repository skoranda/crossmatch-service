"""Golden-signal Prometheus instruments for the crossmatch service (U6).

Two exposition contexts share the same instrument definitions:

* Broker consumers (``run_*_ingest.py``) are single long-running processes.
  They call :func:`start_metrics_server`, which serves the default in-process
  registry, and emit the ingest counter + last-success gauge through
  ``brokers.ingest_alert``.

* Celery prefork workers fork child processes, so a single in-process registry
  would report only one child. When ``PROMETHEUS_MULTIPROC_DIR`` is set the
  instruments transparently use ``prometheus_client`` multiprocess mode: each
  child writes to the shared directory and the worker parent serves the
  aggregated view (see :func:`render_metrics` / :func:`start_metrics_server`).
  ``crossmatch/project/celery.py`` starts the parent server in ``worker_init``
  and cleans up dead children in ``worker_process_shutdown``.

The instruments are defined once at import; multiprocess vs. single-process is
decided at server/exposition time by the presence of ``PROMETHEUS_MULTIPROC_DIR``,
so the same module works unchanged in both contexts.
