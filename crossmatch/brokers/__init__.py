    Alerts remain at status=INGESTED for the Celery Beat batch dispatcher
    to pick up. Returns True on first delivery, False if already delivered.

    Read-model columns are populated first-seen: ``reliability`` (the broker's
    real/bogus score, or None when absent) and ``healpix_ipix`` (derived from
    the coordinates) are written only when the Alert row is first created, via
    the ``get_or_create`` defaults. Repeat deliveries of the same object leave
    both unchanged.
