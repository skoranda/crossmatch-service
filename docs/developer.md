## Requirements

- Docker with Compose plugin "docker compose"

## Dependencies

`crossmatch/requirements.base.txt` is the human-edited source of truth — add,
remove, or re-pin top-level dependencies there. `crossmatch/requirements.lock`
is the fully-pinned transitive lock compiled from it with `pip-compile`
(pip-tools). The image build installs from the lock (`docker/Dockerfile`), so
the lock — not `requirements.base.txt` — is what determines the versions that
actually ship. This is what keeps the `hats==0.9.0` pin (and the rest of the
tree) reproducible across rebuilds.

After editing `requirements.base.txt`, regenerate the lock:

```bash
cd crossmatch
pip install pip-tools
pip-compile --strip-extras --output-file=requirements.lock requirements.base.txt
```

Compile under Python 3.12 to match the image. The `lock-drift` GitHub Actions
workflow recompiles on every change to either file and fails the build if the
committed lock does not match — i.e. if `requirements.base.txt` was edited but
the lock was not regenerated.

## Launch local deployment

If you wish to override any of the environment variables, create a `.env` file in the `/docker` directory:

```bash
echo 'DEV_MODE = true' >> docker/.env
```

Launch the local deployment by navigating to the root directory of your repo clone and executing:

```bash
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yaml up -d --build
```

## Testing

## Virtual environment

You may want to use a Python virtual environment when developing code or when testing. In general it is possible to `docker exec` into a running container where the environment is already configured, but sometimes it is convenient to run a script on your host machine. In these cases, you can create a virtual environment and install the requirements locally.

```bash
# Create the venv once
$ python -m venv .venv
# Thereafter, source the activate script prior to running Python scripts that require the project dependencies
$ source .venv/bin/activate
(.venv) 
# Install/update all dependencies 
$ pip install -r crossmatch/requirements.base.txt 
```

## Unit tests

Tests run with `pytest` (via `pytest-django`) in-container, against the compose
`django-db` Postgres service. Bring up the stack, then run the suite:

```bash
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yaml up -d
# test deps come from crossmatch/requirements.dev.txt (pytest, pytest-django, factory_boy)
docker exec -it crossmatch-celery-worker-1 sh -c 'cd /opt/crossmatch && python -m pytest'
```

Config lives in `crossmatch/pytest.ini` (`DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE`, test paths).
Run a subset with a path or `-k`, e.g. `python -m pytest tests/test_dispatch_notifications.py`.
Tests that depend on commit semantics (the dispatch/ordering tests) use
`@pytest.mark.django_db(transaction=True)` and require Postgres — they will not
behave on SQLite.
