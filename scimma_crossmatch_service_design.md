# LSST Alert Matching Service Architecture (ANTARES + Lasair + Pitt-Google + Gaia + DES)

This document defines a Python-based service architecture that receives Rubin/LSST alerts from the **ANTARES**, **Lasair**, and **Pitt-Google** brokers, matches them against the **Gaia DR3** and **DES Y6 Gold** catalogs using **LSDB**, and records results for eventual **feedback to LSST** (return mechanism TBD).

It is an iteration of the original design, updated to:
- Use **Celery** for work orchestration
- Use **Valkey** as the Celery broker/backing store (instead of NATS/JetStream)
- Use **LSDB native crossmatching** (`from_dataframe()` + `crossmatch()`) against HATS catalogs on S3
- Provide more concrete **PostgreSQL table design**, **Python modules**, and **Kubernetes + Docker Compose deployment details**

---

## 1. Goals and Non-Goals

### Goals
- Reliable ingestion of LSST alerts from **multiple brokers** (ANTARES + Lasair + Pitt-Google) for stream resilience and richer science filtering.
- Idempotent processing (safe to retry alert ingest, match jobs, and notifications).
- Horizontal scalability: multiple workers consuming queued crossmatch work.
- Separation of concerns: ingest vs. schedule ingest vs. match vs. notify.
- Observability: logs, metrics, tracing.
- K8s-native deployment using **existing container images** and **Helm charts**.
- Local development via **Docker Compose** using the *same container images*.

### Non-Goals
- Define the final “send-back-to-LSST” protocol (we only define internal interfaces and a placeholder service).
- Build a complete science-quality vetting pipeline.

---

## 2. High-Level Architecture

### 2.1 Components

**A. Broker-side Filters**

All three brokers run their filter upstream of our ingest services, so
alerts that fail the rule are never delivered. ANTARES and Lasair filters
live in the broker's own infrastructure; Pitt-Google's filter is a
JavaScript Single Message Transform (SMT) User-Defined Function (UDF)
that we attach to the Pub/Sub subscription in our own GCP project — also
upstream of our subscriber, but configured by us rather than the broker.
All filters apply the broker filter standard defined in §2.2.

**A1. ANTARES Filter (runs in ANTARES infrastructure)**
- We supply a filter to ANTARES.
- Filter outputs alerts to our client subscription topic (populated via Locus tagging).
- Filter expression: the LSST alert in the Locus must satisfy `lsst_diaSource_reliability >= 0.6`, evaluated against the latest diaSource associated with the diaObject. The exact expression follows ANTARES filter syntax and available alert schema fields.
- **Status — target state.** The currently deployed ANTARES filter uses an SNR + boolean-flag rule (no reliability check); it must be re-issued to ANTARES with the expression above. Operational follow-up.

**A2. Lasair Filter (runs on the Lasair web UI)**

The Lasair user-defined streaming filter `reliability_moderate` produces
the Kafka topic `lasair_366SCiMMA_reliability_moderate`.

**Filter SQL:**

```sql
SELECT
    objects.diaObjectId, objects.firstDiaSourceMjdTai, objects.ra, objects.decl
FROM objects
WHERE
    objects.nDiaSources >= 1
    AND objects.latestR >= 0.6
    AND mjdnow() - objects.lastDiaSourceMjdTai < 1
```

**Field descriptions:**

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `diaObjectId` | LSST DIA object identifier — maps to `lsst_diaObject_diaObjectId` |
| `firstDiaSourceMjdTai` | MJD-TAI timestamp of the object's first detection — used as `event_time` |
| `ra`, `decl` | LSST positional fields (degrees) |

**Filter criteria semantics:**
- `nDiaSources >= 1` — any object with at least one detection. Minimal gate;
  the `latestR` threshold handles quality filtering.
- `latestR >= 0.6` — the broker filter standard (§2.2). `latestR` is the
  Lasair-side alias for the LSST `reliability` column on the latest
  diaSource. The filter name `reliability_moderate` reflects this threshold
  range.
- `lastDiaSourceMjdTai` within 1 day — only recent/active transients are
  delivered; avoids re-delivering old objects on Kafka replay.

**Status — target state.** The currently deployed UI filter uses
`latestR > 0.6`; it must be re-created with the `>=` operator to match
the standard. Operational follow-up.

**B. Alert Ingest Services (run in our Kubernetes cluster)**

Three independent ingest services consume from separate broker streams and write to the same shared `alerts` table.

**B1. ANTARES Ingest Service**
- Subscribes to the ANTARES topic produced by our filter (see A1).
- Validates/normalizes alert payload.
- UPSERTs the alert into `alerts` keyed by `lsst_diaObject_diaObjectId`.
- Records the delivery in `alert_deliveries` (broker=`'antares'`).
- Enqueues a `crossmatch_alert` Celery task **only if the UPSERT created a new row** (i.e., another broker has not already delivered the same alert).

**B2. Lasair Ingest Service**
- Subscribes to the Lasair Kafka topic produced by our streaming filter (see A2).
- Validates/normalizes alert payload against the shared LSST field schema.
- UPSERTs the alert into `alerts` keyed by `lsst_diaObject_diaObjectId`.
- Records the delivery in `alert_deliveries` (broker=`'lasair'`).
- Enqueues a `crossmatch_alert` Celery task **only if the UPSERT created a new row** (i.e., another broker has not already delivered the same alert).

**B3. Pitt-Google Ingest Service**
- Subscribes to the Pitt-Google `lsst-alerts-json` topic via Google Cloud Pub/Sub.
- Uses a server-side attribute filter (`attributes:diaObject_diaObjectId`) to drop alerts without a diaObjectId.
- **Applies the broker filter standard (§2.2) server-side via a Pub/Sub Single Message Transform (SMT) JavaScript UDF**, attached to the subscription via `pittgoogle.pubsub.Subscription.touch(smt_javascript_udf=...)`. The UDF reads `data.diaSource.reliability` from the JSON payload; messages with `reliability < MIN_DIASOURCE_RELIABILITY` or with missing/null reliability are dropped before delivery to our subscriber. The threshold is interpolated from `MIN_DIASOURCE_RELIABILITY` into the UDF source at subscription-touch time.
- Validates/normalizes alert payload using the `pittgoogle.Alert` object properties.
- UPSERTs the alert into `alerts` keyed by `lsst_diaObject_diaObjectId`.
- Records the delivery in `alert_deliveries` (broker=`'pittgoogle'`).
- Enqueues a `crossmatch_alert` Celery task **only if the UPSERT created a new row** (i.e., another broker has not already delivered the same alert).

**C. Crossmatch Workers (Celery workers; runs in our Kubernetes cluster; horizontally scaled)**
- Consume batch crossmatch jobs from Celery.
- Use LSDB to match alerts against all configured HATS catalogs via `lsdb.from_dataframe()` + `catalog.crossmatch()`. See §7.3 for the authoritative per-catalog roster.
- LSDB operates on HATS-formatted (HEALPix-partitioned Parquet) catalogs and uses **Dask** under the hood for parallel, distributed computation. When `DASK_SCHEDULER_ADDRESS` is set, each worker connects to a remote Dask scheduler at startup via `dask.distributed.Client`, offloading computation to dedicated Dask workers. When unset, Dask runs locally within the Celery worker process using the default synchronous scheduler.
- Catalogs are defined in a configurable registry (`CROSSMATCH_CATALOGS` in Django settings). Each entry specifies the catalog name, HATS URL, source ID column, RA/Dec column names, and `payload_columns` declaring the upstream-native columns to fetch and publish for that catalog (per-catalog config detail in §7.3).
- Catalog HATS URLs come from per-catalog env vars (e.g., `GAIA_HATS_URL`, `DES_HATS_URL`, `DELVE_HATS_URL`, `SKYMAPPER_HATS_URL`); the Gaia DR3 default points at the public S3 bucket `s3://stpubdata/hats/gaia/dr3/` (no credentials required); the other defaults point at `https://data.lsdb.io/hats/...` mirrors. Authoritative per-catalog details live in §7.3.
- Each catalog object is cached in a module-level dict (`_catalog_cache`) keyed by catalog name within each worker process (metadata only; lightweight).
- Alert batches (up to 100k) are converted to an LSDB catalog via `from_dataframe()` with adaptive HEALPix partitioning, then crossmatched sequentially against each configured catalog. LSDB loads only the HATS partitions that overlap the alert positions.
- Per-catalog error isolation: if crossmatching fails for one catalog, the remaining catalogs are still processed.
- A later enhancement may introduce **locally cached copies** of relevant HATS partitions to reduce latency and egress costs.
- Record match outputs into PostgreSQL.

**D. Match Notifier Service (runs in our Kubernetes cluster)**
- Watches PostgreSQL for newly created matches.
- Publishes match payloads over **SCiMMA Hopskotch** (Kafka via `hop-client`) — the live primary output channel. See §4.6 for the published-payload shape, lifecycle, and destination routing.
- An LSST return channel (§4.5) remains TBD; when added it lands as another backend handler behind the existing destination-routing registry.
- Records notification attempts and outcomes for retries.

**E. Supporting Infrastructure**
- **PostgreSQL**: system of record (alerts, schedules, match results, notifications, job audit).
- **Valkey**: Celery broker/result backend.
- (Optional) Object storage/cache for LSDB/HATS data, depending on catalog deployment.

### 2.2 Broker Filter Standard

All three brokers (ANTARES, Lasair, Pitt-Google) apply the same filter
rule upstream of our ingest services, so alerts that fail are never
delivered. ANTARES and Lasair filters run in the broker's own
infrastructure; Pitt-Google's filter is a JavaScript Single Message
Transform (SMT) User-Defined Function (UDF) that we attach to the
Pub/Sub subscription in our own GCP project. The rule is:

> **The latest diaSource associated with the diaObject must have
> `reliability >= 0.6`.**

#### Reliability field

`reliability` is the LSST DM real/bogus classification score on the
DiaSource record. It was added to the baseline LSST Alert Production
pipeline in February 2024 by `lsst.meas.transiNet.RBTransiNetTask`, which
runs the **RBTransiNet** ML model ("RB" = Real/Bogus) and writes the score
to the transformed DiaSource catalog and the APDB DiaSource table as the
`reliability` column. The field was previously called `spuriousness`; it
was renamed to `reliability` under ticket DM-39378.

Each broker exposes the field under its own alias:

| Broker        | Field referenced in the filter expression                |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| ANTARES       | `lsst_diaSource_reliability` on the latest diaSource     |
| Lasair        | `objects.latestR` (alias for the latest-diaSource value) |
| Pitt-Google   | `data.diaSource.reliability` in the SMT UDF JS, where `data` is the JSON-parsed message payload (the alert's primary `diaSource` is by construction the latest detection in the LSST alert envelope) |

Alerts whose latest diaSource has missing or null `reliability` fail the
predicate and are dropped, consistent with the standard.

#### Threshold value: `0.6`

The initial threshold of `0.6` admits transient candidates while rejecting
the bulk of artifacts (cosmic rays, edge effects, dipoles, optical
ghosts). The value can be revised over time as we observe filter
behaviour against real survey data.

#### Configuration: `MIN_DIASOURCE_RELIABILITY`

Broker clients implemented in **this codebase** (currently Pitt-Google in
`crossmatch/brokers/pittgoogle/consumer.py`; future broker clients
should live under `crossmatch/brokers/<broker>/`) read the threshold
from a single environment variable:

| Variable                     | Default | Notes                                      |
| ---------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `MIN_DIASOURCE_RELIABILITY`  | `0.6`   | Broker-agnostic; consumed by every broker client added to this repo. |

For Pitt-Google, the threshold is interpolated from
`MIN_DIASOURCE_RELIABILITY` into the SMT JavaScript UDF source at
subscription-touch time. The UDF then runs server-side at Google with the
interpolated value baked in; changing the threshold requires re-deploying
and re-touching the subscription.

Filters that run **outside** this codebase (the ANTARES filter and the
Lasair web-UI filter; see §2.1 A1 and A2) embed the threshold directly
in their expressions. Changing the threshold for those brokers is an
operational task on the broker's own filter management UI, not a code
change in this repo.

#### Comparison operator

The standard uses `>=` (inclusive). Existing broker filters that use `>`
must be re-issued / re-created to use `>=` for consistency.

## 3. Data Flow

1. LSST publishes alert packets → ANTARES receives.
2. Our ANTARES filter selects a subset → ANTARES publishes to our subscription topic.
3. **Any** ingest service (ANTARES, Lasair, or Pitt-Google) receives the alert:
   - UPSERT into `alerts` keyed by `lsst_diaObject_diaObjectId` (`ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`)
   - INSERT into `alert_deliveries` recording the broker name and broker-specific envelope (`ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`)
   - If the UPSERT created a new `alerts` row → submit Celery task `crossmatch_alert(lsst_diaObject_diaObjectId)`
   - If the UPSERT hit a conflict (alert already delivered by the other broker) → skip task enqueue
4. Crossmatch worker(s) run:
   - Celery Beat dispatches batch every 30s when thresholds are met
   - Load batch of QUEUED alerts into pandas DataFrame
   - Convert to LSDB catalog via `from_dataframe()`
   - Crossmatch sequentially against all configured HATS catalogs (see §7.3)
   - Write results to `catalog_matches` (one row per catalog match)
   - Transition all alerts in batch to MATCHED
6. Notifier service:
   - Detect new match rows
   - Publish payloads to **SCiMMA Hopskotch** (the live channel, see §4.6); an LSST return channel remains TBD (§4.5)
   - Track in `notifications`

## 4. Interfaces

### 4.1 ANTARES → Ingest

ANTARES delivers alerts via **Apache Kafka** using the `antares-client` PyPI package
(which wraps `confluent_kafka`). The `StreamingClient` abstracts Kafka consumer setup
including SASL authentication.

**Connection**:
- Python package: `antares-client[subscriptions]` (the `subscriptions` extra installs `confluent_kafka`)
- Source: https://gitlab.com/nsf-noirlab/csdc/antares/client

**Consuming alerts**:

```python
# brokers/antares/consumer.py
from antares_client import StreamingClient

client = StreamingClient(
    topics=[settings.ANTARES_TOPIC],       # e.g. ‘lsst_scimma_quality_transient’
    api_key=settings.ANTARES_API_KEY,      # credentials from ANTARES team
    api_secret=settings.ANTARES_API_SECRET,
    group=settings.ANTARES_GROUP_ID,       # stable string in production
)

for topic, locus in client.iter():
    newest_alert = locus.alerts[0]
    raw = newest_alert.properties          # flat dict with lsst_diaObject_*, ant_* keys
    canonical = normalize_antares(raw)
    ingest_alert(canonical, broker=’antares’)
```

**Data model**: `StreamingClient.iter()` yields `(topic, locus)` tuples. The `Locus`
object has top-level attributes (`locus_id`, `ra`, `dec`, `properties`) but the LSST
alert fields (`lsst_diaObject_*`, `lsst_diaSource_*`, `ant_*`) are in
`locus.alerts[0].properties`, not `locus.properties`. The `locus.properties` dict
contains only summary metadata (`num_alerts`, `brightest_alert_magnitude`, etc.).

**Filtering**: Not all alerts from ANTARES carry `lsst_diaObject_diaObjectId`. Alerts
missing this field are skipped with an info-level log (not treated as errors).

**GroupID semantics**:
- Keep the GroupID **constant in production** — Kafka uses it to track the consumer’s
  read position and delivers each message exactly once, resuming after restarts.
- Leave the GroupID **empty in development** — `settings.py` generates a unique
  timestamp-suffixed ID so each container restart replays all cached alerts.

**Authentication**: `StreamingClient` authenticates via SASL using `api_key` and
`api_secret` credentials obtained from the ANTARES team. Typically one set of
credentials per institution; only one active streaming client per credential set
unless authorized otherwise.

**Error handling**: Exponential backoff (1 s initial, 60 s max) on streaming errors.
On exception, the consumer reconnects by creating a new `StreamingClient`. Per-alert
ingestion errors are logged but do not interrupt the stream.

**Ingest requirements**:
- Reconnect/resume semantics via the Kafka GroupID (automatic on restart with a stable GroupID).
- Backpressure (limit concurrent DB writes; retry on DB unavailability).
- Deduplication keyed by `lsst_diaObject_diaObjectId` (UPSERT handles this; `alert_deliveries` UNIQUE constraint prevents duplicate delivery rows).

**Environment variables**:

| Variable | Example | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `ANTARES_API_KEY` | `<api-key>` | SASL credential from ANTARES team |
| `ANTARES_API_SECRET` | `<api-secret>` | SASL credential from ANTARES team |
| `ANTARES_TOPIC` | `lsst_scimma_quality_transient` | topic name from ANTARES |
| `ANTARES_GROUP_ID` | `scimma-crossmatch-prod` | stable in production; empty in dev |

### 4.2 Ingest → Celery
We enqueue a Celery task with the minimal durable key (`lsst_diaObject_diaObjectId`). The worker loads all needed fields from Postgres to avoid large messages.

Recommended Celery task signature:
- `crossmatch_alert(lsst_diaObject_diaObjectId: str, match_version: int = 1)`

### 4.3 Lasair → Ingest

Lasair delivers alerts via **Apache Kafka** using the `lasair` PyPI package (which wraps `confluent_kafka`).

**Connection**:
- Kafka server: `lasair-lsst-kafka.lsst.ac.uk:9092`
- Python package: `lasair` (installs `confluent_kafka` as a dependency)

**Consuming alerts**:

```python
# brokers/lasair/ingest.py
import json
from lasair import lasair_consumer

consumer = lasair_consumer(
    kafka_server=settings.LASAIR_KAFKA_SERVER,   # lasair-lsst-kafka.lsst.ac.uk:9092
    group_id=settings.LASAIR_GROUP_ID,           # stable string in production
    topic=settings.LASAIR_TOPIC,                 # lasair_{uid}_{filter_name}
)
while True:
    msg = consumer.poll(timeout=20)
    if msg:
        alert = json.loads(msg.value())
        handle_alert(alert)
```

**Topic naming**: Topics follow the pattern `lasair_{user_id}_{sanitised_filter_name}`
(e.g., `lasair_42_high-snr-transients`). Topics are created via the Lasair web UI when
a streaming filter is saved. The topic name changes if the filter is renamed.

**GroupID semantics**:
- Keep the GroupID **constant in production** — Kafka uses it to track the consumer's
  read position and delivers each message exactly once, resuming after restarts.
- Change the GroupID in development/testing to replay all cached alerts (last ~7 days
  retained by the Kafka server).

**Authentication**: `lasair_consumer` connects to `lasair-lsst-kafka.lsst.ac.uk:9092`
**without any credentials** — no SASL username/password and no bearer token are
required. The Lasair REST API uses a bearer token (`lasair_client(token=...)`),
but this is not needed for the Kafka consumer ingest path.

**Ingest requirements**:
- Reconnect/resume semantics via the Kafka GroupID (automatic on restart with a stable GroupID).
- Backpressure (limit concurrent DB writes; retry on DB unavailability).
- Deduplication keyed by `lsst_diaObject_diaObjectId` (UPSERT handles this; alert_deliveries UNIQUE constraint prevents duplicate delivery rows).

**Environment variables**:

| Variable | Example | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `LASAIR_KAFKA_SERVER` | `lasair-lsst-kafka.lsst.ac.uk:9092` | |
| `LASAIR_TOPIC` | `lasair_366SCiMMA_reliability_moderate` | created on Lasair web UI |
| `LASAIR_GROUP_ID` | `scimma-crossmatch-prod` | stable in production |
| `LASAIR_TOKEN` | `<api-token>` | REST API token (if needed for auth) |

### 4.4 Pitt-Google → Ingest

Pitt-Google delivers alerts via **Google Cloud Pub/Sub** using the `pittgoogle-client` PyPI package.

**Connection**:
- Transport: Google Cloud Pub/Sub
- Python package: `pittgoogle-client`
- Source: https://github.com/mwvgroup/pittgoogle-client
- Publisher project: `pitt-alert-broker`
- Topic: `lsst-alerts-json` (LSST alerts re-serialized as JSON, deduplicated)

**Consuming alerts**:

```python
# brokers/pittgoogle/consumer.py
import pittgoogle

topic = pittgoogle.Topic(name='lsst-alerts-json', projectid='pitt-alert-broker')
subscription = pittgoogle.Subscription(
    name=settings.PITTGOOGLE_SUBSCRIPTION,
    topic=topic,
    schema_name='default',
)
# Broker filter standard (§2.2): drop alerts whose latest diaSource has
# missing, null, or below-threshold reliability, server-side at Pub/Sub.
# The threshold is interpolated into the UDF source at touch time.
udf_source = build_reliability_udf(threshold=settings.MIN_DIASOURCE_RELIABILITY)

subscription.touch(
    attribute_filter='attributes:diaObject_diaObjectId',
    smt_javascript_udf=udf_source,
)

def msg_callback(alert):
    canonical = normalize_pittgoogle(alert)
    ingest_alert(canonical, broker='pittgoogle')
    return pittgoogle.pubsub.Response(ack=True, result=None)

consumer = pittgoogle.pubsub.Consumer(
    subscription=subscription,
    msg_callback=msg_callback,
)
consumer.stream()  # blocks indefinitely
```

**Topic choice (JSON vs Avro)**: We subscribe to the JSON-formatted
`lsst-alerts-json` topic instead of the Avro-formatted `lsst-alerts`.
Pittgoogle's `LsstSchema` class assumes Confluent wire format (5-byte
schema-ID prefix + Avro payload), which doesn't match the actual `lsst-alerts`
framing and produces fastavro decode errors. The JSON topic carries the
same alerts, deserialized via `json.loads()` with no version-specific
schema handling required.

**Data model**: With `schema_name='default'`, `alert.dict` returns the parsed
JSON payload, preserving the LSST Avro schema's nested structure. Fields are
accessed via `alert.dict['diaObject']['diaObjectId']`, `alert.dict['diaSource']['ra']`,
etc. The `.objectid`, `.sourceid`, `.ra`, `.dec` convenience accessors on
`pittgoogle.Alert` are not used because they require `schema_name='lsst'`.

**Subscription model**: Subscriptions are created in the *subscriber's* Google Cloud
project but attached to Pitt-Google's topic. `subscription.touch()` creates the
subscription if it doesn't exist; it is a no-op if it already exists. The subscription
name must be unique per GCP project; each environment (dev, prod) should use a distinct
name to prevent message splitting.

**Filtering**: Two server-side filters are attached to the subscription:

1. **Attribute filter** (immutable, set at subscription creation):
   `attributes:diaObject_diaObjectId`. Drops alerts without a
   `diaObject_diaObjectId` attribute (e.g., solar system objects).
2. **SMT JavaScript UDF filter** (broker filter standard, §2.2): a
   Pub/Sub Single Message Transform that reads `data.diaSource.reliability`
   from the JSON payload and drops messages whose latest diaSource has
   `reliability < MIN_DIASOURCE_RELIABILITY` or missing/null reliability.
   The threshold is interpolated from `MIN_DIASOURCE_RELIABILITY` into
   the UDF source at subscription-touch time. SMT UDFs can inspect message
   body content; the older Pub/Sub `attribute_filter` mechanism cannot,
   which is why the attribute filter handles only the diaObjectId presence
   check while the SMT UDF handles the body-level reliability check.

**Operational note on threshold changes**: `subscription.touch()` is
documented as creating the subscription if missing. Whether it updates
the SMT UDF on an existing subscription has not been verified against
the pittgoogle-client docs, which lack a concrete example. If `touch()`
does not update the UDF in place, threshold changes will require
subscription re-creation as a deploy step.

**Authentication**: Standard Google Cloud credentials via a service account JSON key
file. Requires two environment variables:
- `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT` — the subscriber's GCP project ID
- `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` — path to the service account key file

The GCP project must have the Pub/Sub API enabled.

**Error handling**: The consumer uses a callback-based `Consumer.stream()` which
dispatches alerts to a `ThreadPoolExecutor`. Normalization errors ack the message
(permanent failure — redelivery won't fix malformed data). Ingest errors nack the
message (transient — Pub/Sub redelivers after the ack deadline). The outer reconnection
loop uses exponential backoff (1 s initial, 60 s max) matching the ANTARES/Lasair pattern.

**Environment variables**:

| Variable | Example | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `PITTGOOGLE_TOPIC` | `lsst-alerts-json` | topic in Pitt-Google's project |
| `PITTGOOGLE_SUBSCRIPTION` | `scimma-crossmatch-lsst-alerts-json` | subscription in subscriber's project |
| `PITTGOOGLE_PUBLISHER_PROJECT` | `pitt-alert-broker` | Pitt-Google's GCP project ID |
| `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT` | `my-gcp-project-123` | subscriber's GCP project ID |
| `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` | `/var/run/secrets/gcp/key.json` | path to SA key file |
| `MIN_DIASOURCE_RELIABILITY` | `0.6` | broker filter standard threshold (§2.2); broker-agnostic |

### 4.5 Notifier → LSST (TBD)
We define a stable internal interface so multiple outbound mechanisms can be swapped in later.

```python
class LsstReturnClient(Protocol):
    def send_match_update(self, lsst_diaObject_diaObjectId: str, payload: dict) -> "DeliveryResult":
        ...
```

### 4.6 Notifier → SCiMMA Hopskotch

Crossmatch results are published to the **SCiMMA Hopskotch** Kafka service using
the `hop-client` PyPI package. This is the first concrete output channel; the LSST
return channel (§4.5) remains TBD.

**Publishing library**: `hop-client` on PyPI (wraps `confluent_kafka`).
- Source: https://github.com/scimma/hop-client
- Docs: https://hop-client.readthedocs.io/en/stable/

**Publishing messages**:

```python
# notifier/impl_hopskotch.py
from hop import Stream
from hop.auth import Auth

auth = Auth(user=settings.HOPSKOTCH_USERNAME, password=settings.HOPSKOTCH_PASSWORD)
stream = Stream(auth=auth)

url = f"{settings.HOPSKOTCH_BROKER_URL}/{settings.HOPSKOTCH_TOPIC}"
with stream.open(url, "w") as producer:
    producer.write(payload)   # plain dict → auto-serialized as JSON
```

**Message payload**: Each published message is a JSON dict with six generic top-level fields plus a catalog-specific `catalog_payload` object. The shape is assembled in `tasks/crossmatch.py` and published verbatim by `notifier/impl_hopskotch.py`. Example for a Gaia DR3 match:

```json
{
    "diaObjectId": 123456789,
    "ra": 150.123,
    "dec": 2.456,
    "catalog_name": "gaia_dr3",
    "catalog_source_id": "4567890123456789",
    "separation_arcsec": 0.42,
    "catalog_payload": {
        "phot_g_mean_mag": 18.34,
        "phot_bp_mean_mag": 18.71,
        "phot_rp_mean_mag": 17.82,
        "parallax": 1.247,
        "pmra": -3.41,
        "classprob_dsc_combmod_star": 0.92,
        "ruwe": 1.08
    }
}
```

The six top-level fields (`diaObjectId` through `separation_arcsec`) are generic across all catalogs. The `catalog_payload` object is catalog-specific: its keys are the **lowercased upstream-native column names** declared in `settings.CROSSMATCH_CATALOGS[*].payload_columns` for that catalog (see §7.3 for the per-catalog configuration). For example, a DES Y6 Gold match's `catalog_payload` carries `wavg_mag_psf_g`, `bdf_t`, `dnf_z`, etc. (DES's UPPERCASE upstream names lowercased at publish time); a SkyMapper DR4 match's `catalog_payload` carries `u_psf`, `raj2000`, `class_star`, etc. (the J2000 suffix is preserved because the upstream name is already lowercase). Values are coerced to JSON-native scalars at the publish boundary; missing values appear as JSON `null`, and the key set is stable per catalog regardless of per-row nulls.

**Consumer evolution policy**: Consumers must treat unknown `catalog_payload` keys as additive. New catalogs may add keys, and existing catalogs may grow their `payload_columns` without a schema-version bump; the published-payload contract is discriminated by `catalog_name`, not by a version field. The six generic top-level fields are stable.

For full depth on the per-catalog declarative publish contract, see [`docs/solutions/conventions/catalog-specific-payload-columns.md`](docs/solutions/conventions/catalog-specific-payload-columns.md). For depth on the numpy/pandas → JSON-native value coercion at the publish boundary (including `pd.isna` sentinel coverage and the bool-before-int rule), see [`docs/solutions/design-patterns/coerce-numpy-pandas-scalars-to-json.md`](docs/solutions/design-patterns/coerce-numpy-pandas-scalars-to-json.md).

**Notification lifecycle**:
1. `crossmatch_batch` creates `Notification` rows (state=`pending`,
   destination=`hopskotch`) alongside `CatalogMatch` rows.
2. A periodic Celery Beat task (`dispatch_notifications`, every 10 s) polls for
   `pending` notifications using `select_for_update(skip_locked=True)`.
3. The dispatcher groups notifications by `destination` and routes to the
   appropriate backend handler via a registry (`notifier/dispatch.py`).
4. The Hopskotch handler opens one Kafka connection per batch, publishes each
   notification individually, and marks each `sent` or `failed`.
5. After a batch, alerts with all notifications `sent` transition to `NOTIFIED`.

**Destination routing**: The `Notification.destination` field enables multiple
output channels. Hopskotch is the first backend (`destination='hopskotch'`).
Adding the LSST return channel requires only a new handler implementation
registered in `notifier/dispatch.py`.

**Authentication**: `hop.auth.Auth(user, password)` using SASL credentials
configured via environment variables.

**Error handling**: Per-notification failures are isolated — a failed publish
marks that notification `FAILED` with `last_error` but does not interrupt the
batch. No automatic retry in the initial implementation.

**Environment variables**:

| Variable | Example | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `HOPSKOTCH_BROKER_URL` | `kafka://kafka.scimma.org` | Kafka broker URL |
| `HOPSKOTCH_TOPIC` | `crossmatch-results` | topic name for publishing |
| `HOPSKOTCH_USERNAME` | `<username>` | SASL credential |
| `HOPSKOTCH_PASSWORD` | `<password>` | SASL credential |

**Local Kafka for testing**: A local Kafka server (`scimma/server:latest` with
`--noSecurity`) can be used instead of production Hopskotch. In Docker Compose,
enable the `local-kafka` profile: `docker compose --profile local-kafka up`.
Then update `.env` to set `HOPSKOTCH_BROKER_URL=kafka://local-kafka:9092` and
`HOPSKOTCH_TOPIC=crossmatch-test`. Leave `HOPSKOTCH_USERNAME` empty — the
publisher automatically disables authentication when credentials are not set.

## 5. PostgreSQL Database Design

> For running ad-hoc SQL or inspecting these tables in the dockerized dev environment, see [`docs/solutions/developer-experience/query-dev-database-via-docker-exec.md`](docs/solutions/developer-experience/query-dev-database-via-docker-exec.md) — the dev DB's `5432` port is not host-published, so `psql` runs through `docker compose exec django-db`.

### 5.1 Conventions
- `TIMESTAMPTZ` for datetimes.
- `JSONB` for raw payload storage.
- Idempotent writes via **unique constraints + UPSERT**.
- Prefer natural unique keys (e.g., `lsst_diaObject_diaObjectId`) plus surrogate `BIGSERIAL` when helpful.

### 5.2 Tables

#### 5.2.1 `alerts`
Stores raw alerts and normalized fields.

| column | type | notes |
|---|---|---|
| id | BIGSERIAL PK | internal |
| lsst_diaobject_diaobjectid | BIGINT UNIQUE NOT NULL | stable identifier from alert |
| lsst_diasource_diasourceid | BIGINT NULL | candidate identifier |
| ra_deg | DOUBLE PRECISION NOT NULL | normalized |
| dec_deg | DOUBLE PRECISION NOT NULL | normalized |
| event_time | TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL | candidate/observation time |
| ingest_time | TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now() | |
| schema_version | INTEGER NOT NULL | alert schema version |
| payload | JSONB NOT NULL | raw payload |
| status | TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'ingested' | ingested, queued, matched, notified |

Indexes:
- `UNIQUE(lsst_diaobject_diaobjectid)`
- `INDEX(event_time)`
- `INDEX(status)`
- Optional: `GIN(payload)` if querying payload fields.

#### 5.2.1b `alert_deliveries`
Records each broker delivery separately. Allows tracking which broker(s) delivered a
given alert, with per-broker metadata.

| column | type | notes |
|---|---|---|
| id | BIGSERIAL PK | |
| lsst_diaobject_diaobjectid | BIGINT NOT NULL REFERENCES alerts(lsst_diaobject_diaobjectid) | |
| broker | TEXT NOT NULL | `'antares'`, `'lasair'`, or `'pittgoogle'` |
| ingest_time | TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now() | recorded by Django `auto_now_add=True` when the delivery row is inserted |

Constraints:
- `UNIQUE(lsst_diaobject_diaobjectid, broker)` — one record per broker per alert; re-deliveries from the same broker are discarded with `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`.

Indexes:
- `INDEX(lsst_diaobject_diaobjectid)` — supports per-alert delivery lookups.

#### 5.2.2 `catalog_matches`
Stores match outputs for all catalog crossmatches (Gaia, DES, SkyMapper, etc.).

| column | type | notes |
|---|---|---|
| id | BIGSERIAL PK | |
| lsst_diaobject_diaobjectid | BIGINT NOT NULL REFERENCES alerts(lsst_diaobject_diaobjectid) | |
| catalog_name | TEXT NOT NULL | e.g., `'gaia_dr3'`, `'des_dr2'`, `'ps1_dr2'` |
| catalog_source_id | TEXT NOT NULL | Source identifier in the named catalog |
| match_distance_arcsec | DOUBLE PRECISION NOT NULL | angular separation |
| match_score | DOUBLE PRECISION NULL | optional scoring |
| source_ra_deg | DOUBLE PRECISION NULL | cached source position (optional) |
| source_dec_deg | DOUBLE PRECISION NULL | |
| catalog_payload | JSONB NULL | catalog-specific columns (e.g., parallax, mag) |
| match_version | INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 1 | algorithm versioning |
| created_at | TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now() | |

Constraints:
- `UNIQUE(lsst_diaobject_diaobjectid, catalog_name, catalog_source_id, match_version)`

Indexes:
- `INDEX(lsst_diaobject_diaobjectid)`
- `INDEX(catalog_name)`
- `INDEX(catalog_source_id)`

> **Note on `catalog_source_id` type:** Gaia uses 64-bit integer IDs, but DES, PS1, and SkyMapper also use numeric IDs in different formats. Storing as TEXT is universally compatible without data loss.

#### 5.2.3 `crossmatch_runs`
Optional: tracks worker execution attempts for auditing and retries (recommended when using Celery).

| column | type | notes |
|---|---|---|
| id | BIGSERIAL PK | |
| lsst_diaobject_diaobjectid | BIGINT NOT NULL REFERENCES alerts(lsst_diaobject_diaobjectid) | |
| match_version | INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 1 | |
| celery_task_id | TEXT NULL | for correlation |
| state | TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'queued' | queued, running, succeeded, failed |
| attempts | INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 | |
| started_at | TIMESTAMPTZ NULL | |
| finished_at | TIMESTAMPTZ NULL | |
| last_error | TEXT NULL | |
| created_at | TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now() | |
| updated_at | TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now() | |

Constraints:
- Optional: `UNIQUE(lsst_diaobject_diaobjectid, match_version)` if we only want one canonical run per version.

#### 5.2.4 `notifications`
Tracks outbound updates to LSST.

| column | type | notes |
|---|---|---|
| id | BIGSERIAL PK | |
| lsst_diaobject_diaobjectid | BIGINT NOT NULL REFERENCES alerts(lsst_diaobject_diaobjectid) | |
| catalog_match_id | BIGINT NULL REFERENCES catalog_matches(id) | nullable if aggregated |
| destination | TEXT NOT NULL | e.g., lsst-http, kafka-topic |
| payload | JSONB NOT NULL | what we attempted to send |
| state | TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'pending' | pending, sent, failed |
| attempts | INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 | |
| last_error | TEXT NULL | |
| created_at | TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now() | |
| updated_at | TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now() | |
| sent_at | TIMESTAMPTZ NULL | |

Indexes:
- `INDEX(state)`
- `INDEX(lsst_diaobject_diaobjectid)`

### 5.3 Transaction Boundaries & Idempotency

**Ingest service (atomic two-step pattern)**

With ANTARES and Lasair ingest processes running concurrently, the following two-step
pattern is safe and race-condition-free under concurrent access:

```sql
-- Step 1: attempt to create the canonical alert row
INSERT INTO alerts (lsst_diaobject_diaobjectid, ra_deg, dec_deg, ...)
VALUES (...)
ON CONFLICT (lsst_diaobject_diaobjectid) DO NOTHING
RETURNING id;
-- Row returned → new alert → enqueue crossmatch_alert Celery task
-- Nothing returned → alert already ingested by the other broker → skip enqueue
```

PostgreSQL guarantees exactly one `INSERT` wins under concurrent access, so exactly one
ingest process enqueues the crossmatch task — even if both brokers deliver the same alert
within milliseconds of each other.

```sql
-- Step 2: record the broker delivery (always; idempotent)
INSERT INTO alert_deliveries (lsst_diaobject_diaobjectid, broker)
VALUES (...)
ON CONFLICT (lsst_diaobject_diaobjectid, broker) DO NOTHING;
-- Re-deliveries from the same broker are silently discarded.
-- ingest_time is set automatically by the Django model's auto_now_add.
```

Both steps should be executed in a single database transaction.

Additionally:
- If Celery enqueue fails, keep DB state at `ingested` and retry enqueue.

**Crossmatch worker (batch)**
- Load QUEUED alerts by `batch_ids` into pandas DataFrame.
- Crossmatch via LSDB `from_dataframe()` + `crossmatch()`.
- Write `CatalogMatch` rows via `bulk_create(ignore_conflicts=True)`.
- Transition ALL alerts in batch to MATCHED (both matched and unmatched).
- On failure: revert all alerts in batch to INGESTED for retry in next batch.

**Notifier**
- Insert a `notifications` row before sending.
- Update to sent/failed; retry with backoff.

---

## 6. Queue / Task Orchestration (Celery + Valkey)

### 6.1 Why Celery
- Native Python task queue with mature retry/backoff primitives.
- Fits the “many workers pulling crossmatch jobs” pattern.
- Easy to run as separate Deployments in Kubernetes.

### 6.2 Valkey usage pattern
- Valkey is used as:
  - Celery broker (`redis://valkey:6379/0`)
  - (Optional) Celery result backend (`redis://valkey:6379/1`) **or** disable results if not needed.

### 6.3 Delivery semantics
- Celery provides *at-least-once execution*; tasks can be re-delivered if workers crash.
- We rely on DB idempotency (UPSERT + unique constraints) to make retries safe.

### 6.4 Celery configuration recommendations
- `task_acks_late=True` (ack after work completes)
- `worker_prefetch_multiplier=1` (avoid long task hoarding)
- `task_reject_on_worker_lost=True`
- Per-task retry policy (e.g., `autoretry_for=(Exception,)`, `retry_backoff=True`, `max_retries=N`)

---

## 7. LSDB Multi-Catalog Crossmatch Design

### 7.1 LSDB Native Batch Crossmatching

LSDB is designed to efficiently perform large-catalog crossmatches by leveraging **HATS-formatted (HEALPix Adaptive Tiling Scheme) catalogs, lazy evaluation, and Dask parallelism**. Instead of loading entire catalogs into memory, LSDB only reads the HATS partitions that spatially overlap the input data.

### Batch Crossmatch Workflow

Alerts are processed in batches (up to 100k per batch). The crossmatch workflow uses LSDB’s `from_dataframe()` + `crossmatch()` API:

1. **Load QUEUED alerts** into a pandas DataFrame with `uuid`, `lsst_diaObject_diaObjectId`, `ra_deg`, `dec_deg`.
2. **Convert to LSDB catalog** via `lsdb.from_dataframe(df, ra_column=’ra_deg’, dec_column=’dec_deg’)`. This assigns adaptive HEALPix partitioning (orders 0-7) based on the alert sky positions. The LSDB alerts catalog is built once and reused for all reference catalogs.
3. **Loop through configured catalogs** (`settings.CROSSMATCH_CATALOGS`). For each catalog:
   - Load/cache the HATS catalog via `lsdb.open_catalog()` with catalog-specific columns (source ID, RA, Dec).
   - Crossmatch via `alerts_catalog.crossmatch(catalog, n_neighbors=1, radius_arcsec=CROSSMATCH_RADIUS_ARCSEC, suffixes=(‘_alert’, ‘_catalog’), suffix_method=’overlapping_columns’)`. LSDB only loads HATS partitions overlapping the alert positions.
   - Compute results via `matches.compute()`, returning a pandas DataFrame with a `_dist_arcsec` column.
   - Write `CatalogMatch` and `Notification` rows for each match.
   - Per-catalog error isolation: if one catalog fails, remaining catalogs are still processed.
4. **Transition all alerts** in the batch to MATCHED after all catalogs are processed.

```python
import lsdb
from django.conf import settings

# Module-level cache: {catalog_name: lsdb_catalog}
_catalog_cache = {}

# Alert-side column names that would collide with catalog columns under
# suffix_method='overlapping_columns'. Reject configs that name any of these
# in payload_columns up front so the publish-side key mapping doesn't silently
# break later. Keep in sync with the alerts DataFrame built in tasks/crossmatch.py.
_ALERT_COLUMNS = {'uuid', 'lsst_diaObject_diaObjectId', 'ra_deg', 'dec_deg'}


def _load_columns(catalog_config):
    """source-id + RA + Dec + any configured payload_columns (deduplicated)."""
    return list(dict.fromkeys([
        catalog_config['source_id_column'],
        catalog_config['ra_column'],
        catalog_config['dec_column'],
        *catalog_config.get('payload_columns', []),
    ]))


def _get_catalog(catalog_config):
    name = catalog_config['name']
    if name not in _catalog_cache:
        url = catalog_config['hats_url']
        requested = _load_columns(catalog_config)

        collisions = [c for c in requested if c in _ALERT_COLUMNS]
        if collisions:
            raise ValueError(
                f"{name}: requested columns {collisions} collide with alert "
                f"columns; the crossmatch would suffix them and break payload "
                f"key mapping. Rename or drop them from payload_columns."
            )

        # open_catalog with no `columns` loads only the catalog's *default*
        # columns, so introspect the full schema with columns="all".
        available = set(lsdb.open_catalog(url, columns="all").columns)
        missing = [c for c in requested if c not in available]
        if missing:
            raise ValueError(
                f"{name}: requested columns not found in catalog schema: "
                f"{missing}. Check name/case against docs/references/"
                f"{name}-columns.md."
            )

        _catalog_cache[name] = lsdb.open_catalog(url, columns=requested)
    return _catalog_cache[name]


def crossmatch_alerts(alerts_catalog, catalog_config):
    catalog = _get_catalog(catalog_config)
    matches = alerts_catalog.crossmatch(
        catalog, n_neighbors=1,
        radius_arcsec=settings.CROSSMATCH_RADIUS_ARCSEC,
        suffixes=('_alert', '_catalog'),
        suffix_method='overlapping_columns',
    )
    return matches.compute()
```

### Why Not Visit-Based Spatial Constraints

The original design considered using Rubin telescope pointing data (via HEROIC) to constrain spatial queries. This was removed because:

- **Alerts have precise coordinates** — visit pointings only give ~3.5 degree field centers, far less precise than the alert RA/Dec.
- **HATS uses adaptive partitioning** — LSDB’s `from_dataframe()` handles partition alignment automatically. No manual HEALPix cell grouping needed.
- **Visit footprints are too large** — a single Rubin visit (~9.6 sq deg) spans dozens of HATS partitions, loading many tiles with no alerts.
- **Alerts span multiple visits** — a batch of 100k alerts may come from multiple visits, nights, and filters.
- **No external dependency** — eliminates the HEROIC API dependency, periodic sync task, and associated failure modes.

See `healpix_vs_visit_crossmatch.md` for the full analysis.

### Margin Caches and Edge Effects

LSDB supports **margin caches** — additional overlap regions around HEALPix partitions so that objects near tile boundaries are not missed. When a catalog lacks a margin cache, LSDB emits a `RuntimeWarning: Right catalog does not have a margin cache. Results may be incomplete and/or inaccurate.`

Current margin cache status (as of 2026-03-23):

| Catalog | Margin Cache |
|---------|-------------|
| Gaia DR3 | Yes |
| DES Y6 Gold | Yes |
| DELVE DR3 Gold | No |
| SkyMapper DR4 | No |

At a 1 arcsec crossmatch radius, the practical impact of missing margin caches is small — the fraction of sky area within 1 arcsec of a HEALPix tile boundary is tiny. The vast majority of matches are unaffected. This limitation is accepted for now. If the upstream HATS data providers add margin caches in the future, `open_catalog()` will pick them up automatically with no code changes needed.

### 7.2 Match policy (initial)
- Store the best match (nearest neighbor) within a configurable radius.
- Config: `CROSSMATCH_RADIUS_ARCSEC` (default 1.0 arcsec; configurable via env var).
- `n_neighbors=1` (hardcoded; add configurable setting only when a science use case emerges).
- Tie-breaking: smallest separation (handled by LSDB's KDTreeCrossmatch).

### 7.3 Catalog Registry and Expansion

The system uses a configurable catalog registry (`CROSSMATCH_CATALOGS` in Django settings) that currently includes:

- **Gaia DR3** — accessed from `s3://stpubdata/gaia/gaia_dr3/public/hats` (source ID: `source_id`, RA/Dec columns: `ra`/`dec`)
- **DES Y6 Gold** — accessed from `https://data.lsdb.io/hats/des/des_y6_gold` (source ID: `COADD_OBJECT_ID`, RA/Dec columns: `RA`/`DEC`)
- **DELVE DR3 Gold** — accessed from `https://data.lsdb.io/hats/delve/delve_dr3_gold` (source ID: `COADD_OBJECT_ID`, RA/Dec columns: `RA`/`DEC`)
- **SkyMapper DR4** — accessed from `https://data.lsdb.io/hats/skymapper_dr4/catalog` (source ID: `object_id`, RA/Dec columns: `raj2000`/`dej2000`)

Each catalog entry specifies: `name`, `hats_url`, `source_id_column`, `ra_column`, `dec_column`, and `payload_columns`. The `payload_columns` list declares the upstream-native column names to fetch from the HATS catalog and publish (lowercased) in each match's `catalog_payload` — it is the single source of truth for what publishes for that catalog. See [`docs/solutions/conventions/catalog-specific-payload-columns.md`](docs/solutions/conventions/catalog-specific-payload-columns.md) for the full convention.

**Catalogs are not symmetric.** Several properties differ per catalog and a reader (or implementer) following the "all configured catalogs" abstraction elsewhere in this doc should expect:

- **Case conventions:** Gaia DR3 and SkyMapper DR4 use lowercase column names upstream; DES Y6 Gold and DELVE DR3 Gold use UPPERCASE. SkyMapper additionally carries the J2000 suffix on its coordinates (`raj2000`/`dej2000`). The case rule is preserved end-to-end: `payload_columns` is declared in upstream-native case, and lowercasing happens only at publish time (so `WAVG_MAG_PSF_G` becomes `wavg_mag_psf_g`, but `raj2000` is preserved).
- **Footprints:** Each catalog covers a different sky region. When a batch's alert positions miss a catalog's footprint, LSDB raises `RuntimeError("Catalogs do not overlap")` and the task loop logs it and continues — no-overlap is a normal outcome (e.g., DES Y6 Gold yields no matches for alerts outside its southern footprint).
- **Available columns:** Gaia DR3 carries astrometric columns (parallax, proper motion) that DES/DELVE/SkyMapper lack; DES and DELVE carry shape (`BDF_*`) and photo-z (`DNF_*`) columns Gaia/SkyMapper lack; DELVE drops DES's `Y` band (4 bands instead of 5); SkyMapper DR4 exposes only PSF photometry across `u v g r i z`, no shape or photo-z. Per-catalog `payload_columns` reflects these differences directly — see `docs/references/<catalog>-columns.md` for authoritative per-catalog column lists.
- **Margin caches:** Gaia DR3 and DES Y6 Gold ship margin caches; DELVE DR3 Gold and SkyMapper DR4 do not (see §7.1 *Margin Caches and Edge Effects* for the table and impact).

For depth on the value-coercion at the publish boundary (numpy/pandas → JSON-native, missing-value handling), see [`docs/solutions/design-patterns/coerce-numpy-pandas-scalars-to-json.md`](docs/solutions/design-patterns/coerce-numpy-pandas-scalars-to-json.md).

Planned future catalogs:

- **Pan-STARRS1 (PS1)**

Adding a new catalog requires: a new entry in `CROSSMATCH_CATALOGS` with `name`/`hats_url`/`source_id_column`/`ra_column`/`dec_column`/`payload_columns` (the latter declared in upstream-native case and validated against `docs/references/<catalog>-columns.md`); the corresponding `{CATALOG}_HATS_URL` env var; and a new `docs/references/<catalog>-columns.md` capturing the authoritative column list. No changes to the core ingestion, queueing, matching logic, or deployment architecture are needed.

### 7.4 Dask Cluster Requirements

When using a remote Dask scheduler (via `DASK_SCHEDULER_ADDRESS`), both the **scheduler and workers** must have the same Python packages installed as the crossmatch-service. Dask uses pickle serialization to transfer task graphs between the client (Celery worker), scheduler, and Dask workers. If any component is missing a required module, deserialization fails with `ModuleNotFoundError`.

**Required packages on Dask scheduler and workers:**
- `lsdb` (and its transitive dependencies: `nested_pandas`, `hats`, `mocpy`, etc.) — currently pinned at `lsdb==0.9.0` in `crossmatch/requirements.base.txt`; bumping LSDB or any cluster-aligned pin requires updating every pin site atomically and re-deploying the cluster image. See [`docs/solutions/conventions/dependency-pin-upgrade-pattern-2026-05-12.md`](docs/solutions/conventions/dependency-pin-upgrade-pattern-2026-05-12.md) for the multi-site pin convention.
- `numpy`, `pandas` — pinned to the same versions as the crossmatch-service
- `s3fs` — for reading HATS catalogs from S3
- Python version must match (currently 3.12)

**Local development:** Docker Compose includes optional `dask-scheduler` and `dask-worker` services behind a `dask-scheduler` profile, using the official Dask image (`ghcr.io/dask/dask`) with packages installed at startup via the `EXTRA_PIP_PACKAGES` environment variable. Activate with `docker compose --profile dask-scheduler up`. When the profile is not active, Dask runs locally within each Celery worker using its default synchronous scheduler.

**Kubernetes production:** The Dask cluster is managed as a separate project, not by the crossmatch-service Helm chart. The Dask cluster is shared infrastructure used by multiple consumers. The crossmatch-service connects to it via the `DASK_SCHEDULER_ADDRESS` env var (set in Helm values to the Kubernetes service DNS name). Responsibility for ensuring the Dask cluster has compatible packages installed lies with the Dask cluster project.

**Why exact version pinning is required (no escape hatch):**

We investigated whether a pickle-protocol setting or alternative Dask serializer could make minor version drift between the client and the cluster tolerable. It cannot. The findings:

- **Root cause is class layout, not pickle protocol.** Failures stem from `__reduce__` output and internal C-extension layout changes in numpy and pandas across versions (e.g., pandas `BlockManager` internals changed between minor releases — distributed issue #8605). Pickle protocol 5 has been the default since Python 3.8 and works identically across all currently-supported Python versions; setting it explicitly does nothing.
- **Dask's serializer knobs don't help.** `Client(serializers=[...], deserializers=[...])` only changes the order serializers are tried; cloudpickle remains the mandatory fallback for arbitrary task graphs and user functions. `distributed.scheduler.pickle: false` is a security-hardening flag that breaks normal task submission. msgpack handles only small admin messages, not DataFrames or task graphs. There is no Arrow-only mode.
- **LSDB exposes no serialization knob.** HATS catalogs, margin caches, and crossmatch algorithm subclasses are ordinary Python objects shipped to workers via Dask's default `dask`+`cloudpickle` path.
- **Community consensus is unambiguous.** Every Dask forum and docs discussion ends at "client, scheduler, and workers must have a consistent software environment." Recent distributed releases tightened this to include the scheduler.

The only realistic mitigations are operational: (1) ship the client in the same container image as the workers so versions are identical by construction, (2) call `Client.get_versions()` at startup to fail fast on drift instead of mid-task, and (3) derive the client lockfile from `pip freeze` on the cluster image so client pins update automatically when the cluster image rebuilds.

Mitigation #2 is implemented in `crossmatch/core/dask.py` and runs at Celery master startup (via the `worker_init` signal). It waits for the cluster to be reachable and ≥1 Dask worker to register, then compares Python plus key packages (distributed, dask, msgpack, cloudpickle, toolz, tornado, numpy, pandas) across client/scheduler/workers. Drift or timeout calls `sys.exit(1)` in the master, exiting the worker pod non-zero (CrashLoopBackOff in Kubernetes). A separate `worker_process_init` handler then constructs the per-fork `dask.distributed.Client` that registers as the default scheduler for LSDB. The check must run in the master because `WorkerShutdown` and unhandled exceptions raised from a forked child are swallowed by Celery's billiard wrapper and result in an infinite respawn loop. The total wait is configurable via `DASK_VERSION_CHECK_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` (default 300s; the local `docker-compose.yaml` overrides to 600s to absorb cold `EXTRA_PIP_PACKAGES` installs).

## 8. Python Implementation

### 8.1 Runtime and libraries
- Python 3.12 (constrained by Dask cluster compatibility)

Core libraries:
- **Web/ORM framework:** **Django** (Django ORM + built-in migrations)
- **Queue:** `celery`, `valkey`
- **DB driver:** `psycopg` (v3) via Django’s PostgreSQL backend
- **Config:** `pydantic-settings` (optional) or Django settings module with environment variable parsing (e.g., `django-environ`)
- **HTTP:** `httpx` (for future LSST return)
- **Time conversions:** `astropy` (for MJD ↔ datetime as needed)
- **Observability:** `structlog`, `prometheus-client`, optional `opentelemetry-sdk`
- **LSDB:** `lsdb` Python APIs

Rationale:
- We use **Django** for the ORM and migrations to align with a potential future web UI that exposes system state.
- This also aligns with the SCiMMA **Blast** application’s established stack (Django + Celery + Valkey + PostgreSQL), reducing operational and developer friction.

### 8.3 Key processes (containers)
We will run the long-lived processes as Django management commands (so they share settings, logging, ORM initialization, and consistent configuration).

- **ANTARES ingest service**: `python manage.py run_antares_ingest`
- **Lasair ingest service**: `python manage.py run_lasair_ingest`
- **Pitt-Google ingest service**: `python manage.py run_pittgoogle_ingest`
- **Celery worker(s)** (crossmatch): `celery -A project worker -Q crossmatch -l INFO`
- **Celery beat**: `celery -A project beat` — dispatches the periodic `crossmatch_batch` and `dispatch_notifications` tasks (see §4.6 for the notifier dispatch lifecycle; the notifier does not run as a separate long-lived process).

Database schema changes are managed with Django migrations:
- `python manage.py makemigrations`
- `python manage.py migrate`

### 8.4 Celery task definitions

- `tasks.crossmatch.crossmatch_batch(batch_ids: list, match_version: int = 1)` — processes a batch of alert UUIDs through LSDB crossmatch against all configured catalogs (see §7.3).
- `tasks.schedule.dispatch_crossmatch_batch()` — periodic task (every 30s) that checks batch thresholds and dispatches `crossmatch_batch` with the selected alert IDs.

## 9. Deployment

### 9.1 Kubernetes

**Deployment model (k8s GitOps).** Cluster deployment is driven from a separate GitLab repo, `crossmatch-service-k8s-gitops`, which holds the Helm values overlay (image tag pin, env-var bindings, secret references). This repo publishes container images to the **public GitLab Container Registry** via `.github/workflows/build-image.yml` on semver release tags; the cluster pulls the image anonymously (no pull secret required). The env-var surface between this service and the gitops overlay is enforced by a **deploy env-var contract guardrail** at `deploy-contract.yaml` in this repo, so a service-side env-var rename or removal must be reflected in the gitops overlay before the next deploy. Authoritative implementation details — registry choice rationale, sealed-secret arrangement, Helm overlay shape, rollout procedure — live in the gitops repo and the implementation plan at `docs/plans/2026-06-02-001-feat-crossmatch-service-k8s-gitops-plan.md`.

Deployments (recommended):
- `ingest` Deployment (1–N replicas; ANTARES Kafka consumer)
- `lasair-ingest` Deployment (1 replica; Lasair Kafka consumer)
- `worker-crossmatch` Deployment (N replicas)
- `notifier` Deployment (1–2 replicas)
- `celery-beat` Deployment (1 replica; dispatches crossmatch batches)

Dependencies:
- PostgreSQL (external managed or in-cluster)
- Valkey (in-cluster)

#### 9.1.1 Container images
- Prefer **one service image** with multiple entrypoints/commands.
- All components run the same image tag (ensures reproducibility).

#### 9.1.2 Helm chart approach
The Helm chart at `kubernetes/charts/crossmatch-service/` deploys:
- Our services (ingest, workers, notifier, schedule)
- Optional dependency charts:
  - `valkey`
  - `postgresql` (dev/test only; prod may use managed Postgres)

Values define:
- image repository/tag
- env vars
- secrets
- replica counts
- CPU/memory requests/limits
- node affinity/tolerations (if LSDB needs larger nodes)

#### 9.1.3 Configuration & secrets

The env-var surface below is the contract documented in `deploy-contract.yaml` and consumed by the gitops Helm overlay (see §9.1 *Deployment model*). Topical context for each variable lives in the section that introduces it; this catalog cross-references rather than duplicates.

Environment variables:

**Database & queue**
- `DATABASE_URL=postgresql+psycopg://user:pass@postgres:5432/scimma_crossmatch_service`
- `CELERY_BROKER_URL=redis://valkey:6379/0`
- `CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND=redis://valkey:6379/1` (optional)

**Broker filter standard** (see §2.2)
- `MIN_DIASOURCE_RELIABILITY=0.6` — broker-agnostic threshold; consumed by every broker client in this repo

**ANTARES broker** (see §4.1)
- `ANTARES_API_KEY`, `ANTARES_API_SECRET` — SASL credentials
- `ANTARES_TOPIC=lsst_scimma_quality_transient`
- `ANTARES_GROUP_ID=scimma-crossmatch-prod`

**Lasair broker** (see §4.3)
- `LASAIR_KAFKA_SERVER=lasair-lsst-kafka.lsst.ac.uk:9092`
- `LASAIR_TOPIC=lasair_<uid>_<filter-name>`
- `LASAIR_GROUP_ID=scimma-crossmatch-prod`
- `LASAIR_TOKEN=<api-token>` (REST API; not used by the Kafka consumer)

**Pitt-Google broker** (see §4.4)
- `PITTGOOGLE_TOPIC=lsst-alerts-json` — topic in Pitt-Google's project
- `PITTGOOGLE_SUBSCRIPTION=<subscription-name>` — subscription in our GCP project
- `PITTGOOGLE_PUBLISHER_PROJECT=pitt-alert-broker` — Pitt-Google's GCP project ID
- `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=<our-gcp-project-id>` — our subscriber project ID
- `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/var/run/secrets/gcp/key.json` — path to service account key file

**Hopskotch publishing** (see §4.6)
- `HOPSKOTCH_BROKER_URL=kafka://kafka.scimma.org`
- `HOPSKOTCH_TOPIC=crossmatch-results`
- `HOPSKOTCH_USERNAME`, `HOPSKOTCH_PASSWORD` — SASL credentials

**Crossmatch catalogs** (see §7.3)
- `GAIA_HATS_URL=s3://stpubdata/gaia/gaia_dr3/public/hats`
- `DES_HATS_URL=https://data.lsdb.io/hats/des/des_y6_gold`
- `DELVE_HATS_URL=https://data.lsdb.io/hats/delve/delve_dr3_gold`
- `SKYMAPPER_HATS_URL=https://data.lsdb.io/hats/skymapper_dr4/catalog`
- `CROSSMATCH_RADIUS_ARCSEC=1.0`

**Dask cluster** (see §7.4)
- `DASK_SCHEDULER_ADDRESS=tcp://<host>:<port>` (optional; when unset, Dask runs locally)
- `DASK_VERSION_CHECK_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=300` (default 300s; max wait at startup for cluster + ≥1 worker before the version-drift check fails)

Secrets:
- DB password
- ANTARES credentials (`ANTARES_API_KEY`, `ANTARES_API_SECRET`)
- Pitt-Google service account key file (`GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`)
- Hopskotch SASL credentials (`HOPSKOTCH_USERNAME`, `HOPSKOTCH_PASSWORD`)
- LSST return credentials (future)

#### 9.1.4 Health checks
- Ingest: readiness requires DB connectivity and successful ANTARES client init.
- Workers: readiness requires DB + LSDB catalog reachable.
- Notifier: readiness requires DB.

#### 9.1.5 Observability in cluster
- Expose Prometheus metrics via a small HTTP server per process (e.g., `prometheus_client.start_http_server`).
- Structured logs to stdout.

### 9.2 Local Development (Docker Compose)

Local development uses Docker Compose with the **same images** as in Kubernetes.

Services:
- `postgres`
- `valkey`
- `ingest`
- `worker`
- `notifier`
- `celery-beat` (dispatches crossmatch batches)

Notes:
- Use `.env` for configuration.
- If you want live code edits, either:
  - build a `:dev` image variant that mounts source, or
  - use `docker compose build` frequently.

## 10. Open Questions / Decisions Needed

1. **LSST return channel**: what mechanism do we implement first (HTTP endpoint? Kafka? Rubin-specific API)?
2. **ANTARES topic and auth**: exact configuration fields for `StreamingClient` (topic name, resume semantics).
3. ~~**Match radius and columns**~~ — **Resolved**: 1 arcsec default radius, configurable via `CROSSMATCH_RADIUS_ARCSEC`. Store `source_id`, `ra`, `dec`, and match distance. Consumers query Gaia directly for additional fields.
4. ~~**Planned footprint gating**~~ — **Resolved**: removed. LSDB native crossmatching uses alert RA/Dec directly; no pointing constraints needed.
5. ~~**HEROIC API details**~~ — **Resolved**: HEROIC integration removed. See `healpix_vs_visit_crossmatch.md` for rationale.
6. ~~**Lasair Kafka auth**~~ — **Resolved**: `lasair_consumer` connects to `lasair-lsst-kafka.lsst.ac.uk:9092` without credentials. No SASL config or token required for the ingest path.
7. ~~**Lasair filter/topic**~~ — **Resolved**: filter `reliability_moderate` created on Lasair web UI; topic `lasair_366SCiMMA_reliability_moderate`. Criteria: `latestR >= 0.6` AND `nDiaSources >= 1` AND last detection within 1 day, per the broker filter standard (§2.2). The Lasair UI filter must be re-created to apply the `>=` operator. See §2.1 B2 for full SQL.
8. **Lasair alert schema**: what is the full JSON schema of a Lasair alert? Lasair uses `objectId` as the top-level key — confirm this is always identical to `lsst_diaObject_diaObjectId`. Confirm which field maps to LSST positional fields (RA/Dec).
9. **Lasair annotations to store**: which Lasair-side fields (Sherlock cross-matches, classification scores, etc.) should be preserved in `alert_deliveries.raw_payload`?

---

## 11. Appendices

### 11.1 Suggested first implementation milestone
- Ingest alert → store in DB → batch dispatcher enqueues crossmatch task
- Crossmatch worker: batch match against Gaia DR3 and DES Y6 Gold via LSDB (`from_dataframe()` + `crossmatch()`)
- Store match rows in `catalog_matches` (one row per catalog match)
- Notifier: dummy implementation (logs payload) + `notifications` bookkeeping
